        <h1>The Colosseum</h1>
        <p>
            The Colosseum is an amphitheatre built in Rome under the Flavian emperors of the Roman Empire. It is also called the Flavian Amphitheatre. It is an elliptical structure made of stone, concrete, and tuff, and it stands four stories tall at its highest point. It measures 620 by 513 feet (189 by 156 metres) and could hold as many as 50,000 spectators. The Colosseum was famously used for gladiatorial combat.

        <p>Construction of the Colosseum began under the Roman emperor Vespasian between 70 and 72 CE. The completed structure was dedicated in 80 CE by Titus, Vespasian’s son and successor. The Colosseum’s fourth story was added by the emperor Domitian in 82 CE. Importantly, the arena was paid for with plunder from Titus’s sack of Jerusalem in 70 CE, and it was built by enslaved Jews from Judaea.</p>
