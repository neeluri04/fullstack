            <h1>Great Wall of China</h1>
            <p>The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials. It was built along the northern borders of China to protect against various nomadic groups. The most well-known sections were built by the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644).</p>
            <p>It stretches from Dandong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, along an arc that roughly delineates the southern edge of Inner Mongolia. It has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987 and is often recognized as one of the New 7 Wonders of the World.</p>

            <h1>Chichen Itza</h1>
            <p>Chichen Itza was a large pre-Columbian city built by the Maya people of the Terminal Classic period. The archaeological site is located in Tinúm Municipality, Yucatán State, Mexico.</p>
            <p>Chichen Itza was one of the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been one of the mythical great cities, or Tollans, referred to in later Mesoamerican literature. The city may have had the most diverse population in the Maya world, a factor that could have contributed to the variety of architectural styles at the site.</p>

            <p>The Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, is an oval amphitheatre in the center of the city of Rome, Italy. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world today, despite its age.</p>
            <p>Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in AD 72 and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus. The Colosseum could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators and was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as mock sea battles, animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on classical mythology.</p>

            <h1>Machu Picchu</h1>
            <p>Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru on a mountain ridge 2,430 meters (7,970 ft) above sea level. It is located in the Machupicchu District within Urubamba Province above the Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometers (50 mi) northwest of Cuzco.</p>
            <p>Most archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was constructed as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438–1472). Often mistakenly referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas," it is the most familiar icon of Inca civilization. Machu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historic Sanctuary in 1981 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. In 2007, Machu Picchu was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in a worldwide Internet poll.</p>

            <h1>Petra</h1>
            <p>Petra, originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu or Raqēmō, is a historical and archaeological city in southern Jordan. The city is famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit system. Another name for Petra is the Rose City due to the color of the stone from which it is carved.</p>
            <p>Established possibly as early as the 5th century BC as the capital city of the Nabataean Kingdom, it is a symbol of Jordan as well as Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction. It lies on the slope of Jebel al-Madhbah (identified by some as the biblical Mount Hor) in a basin among the mountains which form the eastern flank of Arabah (Wadi Araba), the large valley running from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. Petra has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985.</p>
